        it is easy to not think <br />
        it is easy to not act <br />
        it is easy to forget yourself <br />
        and be left with nothing but regrets

        There is so much content out there, you get drowned. It's not the fault
        of the creators. It is the problem of consumers. I consume so much, that
        I don't really think about creating. It is easy to not create. And I
        have been choosing easy for so long that I don't even remember if I ever
        created.

        I was defeated again last night. Who defeated me? It was me. The part I
        don't want to but still keep feeding noodles and ice creams to. I let
        myself fail. Failed to show up to an interview. Couldn't gather the
        courage even though I was kind of prepared. But that's what I am afraid
        of, being 'kind of' prepared. Has happened so many times now, 4 or 5
        times. I am a cat.

        Due to my attention being all over the place , I am feeling overwhelmed.
        I need to focus on one thing to accomplish it. I want to get a job right
        now, so that I gain some financial independence. I want to do music as
        my passion. And I need to buy ableton live and serum right now for that.
        I am kind of screwed there. And last but not the least I want to set up
        my brand for passive income.

        The right feminist influencers bring the right perspective to whole
        thing. Those people have experienced different things and understand
        what's currently wrong. They have a truth. A better truth in most cases.
        They are still victim to other cases (that being I feel the whole beauty
        industry stuff, some still need make-up to look confident, others have
        found there own beauty in there work). And we do need the right
        influencers to show that women have the right to choose.

        Using the word LOST is underwhelming. I dread remembering things I have
        thought and things I have done, things I have wished and I should stop
        making a peom out of this.
        <br />
        I was thinking I needed to be original, to have values, to not just
        drift away. Is she happier than me? Is he happier than me? Does it
        matter?

        I am afraid of some aptitude problems. Those include things like water
        tanks, clocks, man-work. Kind of remind me of relative motion in
        physics. I sometimes hated physics, most of the times hated physics. It
        was so hard to wrap my brains around some things like rotation and
        stuff. And I feel many people who took science in their high schools
        felt the same way.
